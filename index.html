 Here is a random cat fact presented in JSON format: <div id="data"></div>   
 <div>
  <a></br>The API I selected simply chooses a fact from a database of cat facts.</br></br>
  I found out about the API from here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1946054/S11HvKSz</br></br>
  The option I used was to get a single general cat fact, while some other options included getting a list of facts or facts specifically about cat breeds.</br></br>
  Two applications for this API could be for a tabloid website-like service where people get random facts, some of which could be cat facts. The other could be for a loading screen for a browser video game, where you could use this simple and quick API to display a random cat fact during the loading screen (especially if the video game involved cats in some way).</a>
